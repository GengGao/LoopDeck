{"prompt":"What is a closure in JavaScript?","response":"A closure is a function that has access to variables from its outer (enclosing) scope, even after the outer function has returned.\n\n```javascript\nfunction createCounter() {\n  let count = 0;  // This variable is \"closed over\"\n  return function() {\n    count++;\n    return count;\n  };\n}\n\nconst counter = createCounter();\nconsole.log(counter()); // 1\nconsole.log(counter()); // 2\nconsole.log(counter()); // 3\n```\n\nClosures are commonly used for:\n- Data privacy/encapsulation\n- Function factories\n- Maintaining state in async operations"}
